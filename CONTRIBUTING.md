# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to COSIG! COSIG is designed to be a constantly-expanding, open source handbook for performing post publication peer review. Each guide can be downloaded [invididually as a PDF](https://osf.io/2kdez/files/osfstorage) and can stand on its own. A combined PDF with all guides included can be downloaded [here](https://osf.io/ynb8j).

If you have suggestions for a new guide, requested revisions or additions to an existing guide (including fixing typos) or questions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/reeserich/cosig/issues) and assign it a corresponding label. Before beginning work on a guide, check if an issue already exists, where others might have shared that they are already working on it.

COSIG's maintainers will evaluate all contributions and decide what to merge into the official COSIG version.

Contributors to COSIG are listed by name or pseudonym at the start of the full COSIG handbook. Note that this is not an authorship list in same style as an academic article; it is a way to thank and give credit to those that gave time to expand COSIG, equivalent to the contributors page on a open source software project ([example](https://github.com/rails/rails/graphs/contributors)). Those that contribute to COSIG are not responsible for all of COSIG's content. Please contact admin@cosig.net to specify how you would like to be credited, providing your [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/) if available. If submitting a Pull Request, put this information in the description.

# LaTeX

COSIG is compiled using [pdfLaTeX](https://www.math.rug.nl/~trentelman/jacob/pdflatex/pdflatex.html) in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). Contributors to COSIG that are not familiar with writing in LaTeX but would like to contribute should consult a maintainer, who can help format your contribution appropriately (get in touch at admin@cosig.net).

# Style

A .tex template for guides is available [here](https://github.com/reeserich/cosig/blob/main/tex/template.tex). Guides should be written in a neutral and professional tone for a diverse audience. Wherever possible, readers should be directed towards additional resources. For highly specialized guides (e.g., [verifying nucleotide sequence reagents](https://osf.io/2egvz)), it is helpful to provide background information for those new to the topic but not necessary to start from the very beginning of a topic (e.g., by explaining the [central dogma of molecular biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology)). Text and graphics that are lifted from other sources should be appropriately attributed with a direct link (e.g., ``Adapted from Figure S1 of [Zhang et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2302491120)'').
